The Streaming library gives you the option of compressing those into “insertion style” code that, if not exactly the same, is reminiscent of the concatenation above:

lcd << "GPS #" << gpsno << " date: " <<
    day << "-" << month << "-" << year << endl;

This library works for any class that derives from Print:

Serial << "Counter: " << counter;
lcd << "Temp: " << t.get_temperature() << " degrees";
my_pstring << "Hi Mom!" << endl;

With the new library you can also use formatting manipulators like this:

Serial << "Byte value: " << _HEX(b) << endl;
lcd << "The key pressed was " << _BYTE(c) << endl;
